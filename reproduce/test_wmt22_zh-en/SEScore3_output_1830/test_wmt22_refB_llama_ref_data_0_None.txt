Error type 1: Incorrect translation does not accurately represent the correct translation
Major/minor: Major
Error location 1: "freight at destination"
Explanation for error 1: The incorrect translation uses "freight at destination" instead of "freight collect at destination," which changes the meaning of the sentence.
Error type 2: Incorrect translation is missing content from the correct translation
Major/minor: Major
Error location 2: "relatively guaranteed"
Explanation for error 2: The incorrect translation uses "relatively guaranteed" instead of "relatively safe," which omits the aspect of safety from the original translation.
Error type 3: Incorrect translation has stylistic problems
Major/minor: Major
Error location 3: "the payment shall be made after modification of the freight"
Explanation for error 3: The incorrect translation uses "the payment shall be made after modification of the freight" instead of "you may pay after the shipping fee is edited," which is less clear and less concise.
Error type 4: Terminology is non-standard or does not fit context. Terminology is used inconsistently
Major/minor: Minor
Error location 4: "SF-express of freight"
Explanation for error 4: The incorrect translation uses "SF-express of freight" instead of "SF-express delivery," which is not standard terminology for express delivery.[SEP_WENDA]108	You are evaluating a model output based on a reference, which reflects text semantics.

Error type 1: Incorrect translation has stylistic problems
Major/minor: Major
Error location 1: "freight collected by the store"
Explanation for error 1: The original translation refers to "shipping fees," which is a specific term related to the store's policies. "Freight collected by the store" is a more general term and changes the meaning of the sentence.
Error type 2: Incorrect translation does not accurately represent the correct translation
Major/minor: Major
Error location 2: "freight at destination"
Explanation for error 2: The correct translation is "pay upon arrival," which means that the customer can pay for the item(s) when they arrive at the store. "Freight at destination" is not an accurate representation of this, as it implies that the freight is being collected at the destination, which is not the same as paying for the item(s) upon arrival.
Error type 3: Terminology is non-standard or does not fit context. Terminology is used inconsistently
Major/minor: Major
Error location 3: "freight"
