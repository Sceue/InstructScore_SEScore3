2. Error Type: Problems with grammar, other than orthography
   Label: Minor
   Error Location: "we can wash hands clean!" instead of "we can wash our hands clean!"
   Explanation: The model generated translation is missing the possessive pronoun "our" before "hands". This is a minor grammatical error that does not significantly change the meaning.[SEP_WENDA]28	You are evaluating a model output based on a reference, which reflects text semantics.
