2. Error Type: Terminology is non-standard or does not fit context
   Label: Minor
   Error Location: "sound" in the model generated translation
   Explanation: The correct translation uses "noises" instead of "sound". While both words can be used to describe the same thing, "noises" is more appropriate in this context as it is more associated with the loudness and intensity of the sound.[SEP_WENDA]558	You are evaluating a model output based on a reference, which reflects text semantics.
