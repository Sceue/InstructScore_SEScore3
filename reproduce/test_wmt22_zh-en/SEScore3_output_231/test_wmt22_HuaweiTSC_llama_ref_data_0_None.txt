Explanation: The model-generated translation uses the term "the threshold" instead of "the threshold is too high" from the correct translation. This is a non-standard terminology and does not fit the context as well as the correct translation.

Error 4:
Type: Incorrect translation includes information not present in the correct translation
Major/Minor: Minor
Error Location: "often"
Explanation: The model-generated translation adds the word "often" which is not present in the correct translation. This addition does not significantly change the meaning but is an unnecessary addition.

Type: Incorrect translation has stylistic problems
Major/Minor: Minor
Error Location: "The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high,"
Explanation: The model-generated translation has a slightly different sentence structure than the correct translation, which affects the overall style. The correct translation is more concise and clear.[SEP_WENDA]1112	You are evaluating a model output based on a reference, which reflects text semantics.

- Error Type: Incorrect translation does not accurately represent the correct translation
- Major/Minor: Minor
- Error Location: "it is possible to put more ordinary people on the road to relative success"
- Explanation: The model-generated translation adds the phrase "it is possible to put" which is not present in the correct translation. The correct translation simply states "a route for more ordinary people to be successful."

Error 2:
- Error Type: Terminology is non-standard or does not fit context
- Major/Minor: Minor
- Error Location: "relative success"
- Explanation: The term "relative success" is not a standard way to express the idea of being successful. The correct translation uses the term "successful" which is more appropriate in this context.[SEP_WENDA]1113	You are evaluating a model output based on a reference, which reflects text semantics. The correct translation is "The core of the “second best principle” is lowering the threshold; it encourages “accumulating small successes to have big success”; even if you cannot reach 100, you can be 1, because 1 is always bigger than 0; if you cannot climb on Mount Tai, you can climb on the small dune in front of your house, because that is still better than marching on the spot.". The model generated translation is "The core of the "second best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages the theory that if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: Because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that is better than standing still.".

Type: Incorrect translation does not accurately represent the correct translation
Major/Minor: Minor
Location: "it encourages the theory that if you can't do 100, you can only do 1"
Explanation: The correct translation should be "it encourages “accumulating small successes to have big success”; even if you cannot reach 100, you can be 1, because 1 is always bigger than 0".

Error 3:
Type: Terminology is used inconsistently
Major/Minor: Minor
Location: "small sand dunes" vs "small dune"
Explanation: The model generated translation uses "small sand dunes" while the correct translation uses "small dune". The meaning is not significantly changed, but the terminology is inconsistent.

Error 4:
Type: Incorrect translation has stylistic problems
Major/Minor: Minor
Location: "Because 1 is always greater than 0;"
Explanation: The correct translation should be "because 1 is always bigger than 0". The model generated translation uses "greater than" instead of "bigger than", which is not incorrect but is a stylistic difference.

Error 5:
Type: Incorrect translation has stylistic problems
Major/Minor: Minor
Location: "that is better than standing still."
Explanation: The correct translation should be "that is still better than marching on the spot."

   Label: Minor
   Error Location: "In short" (model generated translation) vs. "Anyway" (correct translation)
   Explanation: The model generated translation uses "In short" instead of "Anyway," which is a minor difference in meaning but does not significantly change the overall meaning of the sentence.

2. Error Type: Incorrect translation does not accurately represent the correct translation
   Label: Minor
   Error Location: "as long as you do something" (model generated translation) vs. "doing anything" (correct translation)

Type: Incorrect translation does not accurately represent the correct translation
Major/Minor: Minor
Error Location: "there is more possibility for ordinary people to persevere"
Explanation: The correct translation is "the possibility of ordinary people persevering with it is higher". The model-generated translation changes the meaning slightly by saying "there is more possibility" instead of "the possibility is higher".

Error 2:
Type: Incorrect translation does not accurately represent the correct translation
Major/Minor: Minor
Error Location: "as long as they persevere in everything"
Explanation: The correct translation is "the success rate will be higher for anything as long as you persevere".

Error 3:
Type: Terminology is used inconsistently
Major/Minor: Minor
Error Location: "probability of success" vs "success rate"
Explanation: The correct translation uses the term "success rate", while the model-generated translation uses "probability of success". Although both terms convey a similar meaning, they are not consistent in their usage.[SEP_WENDA]1116	You are evaluating a model output based on a reference, which reflects text semantics.

- Error Type: Incorrect translation does not accurately represent the correct translation
- Major/Minor: Major
- Error Location: "the road to success"
- Explanation: The model-generated translation added the concept of "success," which is not present in the correct translation. The correct translation simply refers to the journey being longer, not necessarily about success.

Error 2:
- Error Type: Incorrect translation includes information not present in the correct translation
- Major/Minor: Minor
- Error Location: "that follows"
- Explanation: The model-generated translation added the phrase "that follows," which is not present in the correct translation. This addition does not significantly change the meaning but is an unnecessary addition.

Error 3:
- Error Type: Incorrect translation is missing content from the correct translation
- Major/Minor: Minor
- Error Location: "the journey will be longer"
- Explanation: The model-generated translation does not convey the idea of the journey being longer, which is present in the correct translation. Instead, it talks about the road to success being a little longer, which is not the same as the original meaning.

Error 4:
- Error Type: Incorrect translation does not accurately represent the correct translation
- Major/Minor: Major
- Error Location: "is a little longer"
- Explanation: The model-generated translation uses the phrase "is a little longer," which changes the meaning of the original text.
