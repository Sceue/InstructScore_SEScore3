- Explanation: The model translated "restaurant and delivery person" as "restaurants and riders", which changes the meaning significantly.

Error 2:
- Error Type: Problems with grammar, other than orthography
- Major/Minor: Minor
- Error Location: "you need also"
- Explanation: The use of "also" is unnecessary and makes the sentence sound less natural.[SEP_WENDA]1093	You are evaluating a model output based on a reference, which reflects text semantics.
