Error 2:
Type: Incorrect translation does not accurately represent the correct translation
Major/Minor: Major
Location: "The data says that 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds."
Explanation: The model-generated translation changes the meaning of the sentence by stating that the data says it takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h, while the correct translation says that it takes only 2.9s to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h.

Type: Incorrect translation does not accurately represent the correct translation
Major/Minor: Minor
Location: "Some people have three days, some have a week"
Explanation: The correct translation should be "some people have it for three days and some people a week". The model-generated translation separates the information about the duration of dysmenorrhea into two sentences, which is not accurate.
