Type: Minor Error
Error Location: "or natural olive oil"
Explanation: The model-generated translation uses "or" instead of "also known as" which is a minor difference in meaning. The correct translation implies that natural olive oil is a specific type of olive oil, while the model-generated translation suggests that it is one of two options, natural olive oil or virgin olive oil.

Error 2:
Type: Minor Error
Error Location: "directly from fresh olive fruits"
Explanation: The model-generated translation uses "directly from fresh olive fruits" instead of "from fresh olive fruit". This is a minor difference in meaning, as the correct translation implies that the olive oil is obtained from the fruit itself, while the model-generated translation suggests that the olive oil is obtained directly from the fruits.[SEP_WENDA]295	You are evaluating a model output based on a reference, which reflects text semantics.
