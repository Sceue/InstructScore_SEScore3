Type: Incorrect translation does not accurately represent the correct translation
Major/Minor: Minor
Error Location: "As the threshold is greatly reduced"
Explanation: The correct translation should be "Due to the dramatic lowering of the threshold". The model-generated translation misses the "Due to" and uses "As" instead, which slightly changes the meaning.

Error 2:
Type: Incorrect translation does not accurately represent the correct translation
Major/Minor: Minor
Error Location: "there is more possibility for ordinary people to persist"
Explanation: The correct translation should be "the possibility of ordinary people persevering with it is higher". The model-generated translation uses "persist" instead of "persevering with it" and "more possibility" instead of "higher possibility".
