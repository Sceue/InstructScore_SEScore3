Major/minor: Major
Error location 1: "anti-counterfeit paper"

Major/minor: Major
Error location 2: "the number of affected people has accumulated to 3,200 so far."

Error location 1: "problems with the printing of Sabah's birth certificate"
Explanation for error 1: The original phrasing is "shortage of birth certificates in Sabah" which is a more accurate and direct representation of the issue. The rephrased translation changes the meaning slightly by focusing on the printing rather than the shortage, and also uses "as long as" instead of "for as long as", which is less concise and less formal.
Error type 2: Incorrect translation is missing content from the correct translation
Major/minor: Minor
Error location 2: "in the online media"
Explanation for error 2: The original translation states "in the media", which is a more general term and does not imply that the issue is specifically related to online media.

Major/minor: Major
Error location 3: "I said I would knock on the door"
Explanation for error 3: The incorrect translation reverses the order of events by saying "I said I would knock on the door" instead of "I told the delivery person to knock first."

Error type 3: Wrong grammatical register (eg, inappropriately informal pronouns). Internal inconsistency (not related to terminology)
Major/minor: Major
Error location 3: "it's waiting" instead of "it's waiting for you"
Explanation for error 3: The phrase "it's waiting for you" implies that the delivery person is specifically waiting for the customer, while "it's waiting" does not convey the same level of specificity.
Error type 4: Incorrect translation has stylistic problems
Major/minor: Major
Error location 4: "still telling me" instead of "still telling me it's waiting"
